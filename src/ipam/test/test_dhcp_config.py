    IP Address Management API

    The IPAM/DHCP Application is a BloxOne DDI service providing IP address management and DHCP protocol features. The IPAM component provides visibility into and provisioning tools to manage networking spaces, monitoring and reporting of entire IP address infrastructures, and integration with DNS and DHCP protocols.
